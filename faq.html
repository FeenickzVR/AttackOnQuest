	<h4>Q: Will there be PVP?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: This has been talked about a lot on the discord and tests have been done on dev builds of the game, but the system requires a lot more work before public release.</h5>
	
	<h4>Q: Why is my microphone not working?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: There is a known issue currently that makes the microphone not work in multiplayer if it is your first time installing the game. Please close and re-open the game to fix this.</h5>
	
	<h4>Q: Why does my player collider not stay with me?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: You may notice, as you are playing AOQ, that sometimes your player collider will not always be centered at your current position. This is due to how the game was built and unfortunately will not be fixed any time soon. We recommend playing with a stationary guardian or trying as much as possible not to move from the center of your play space as this is where your collider will always be. For people on Quest 1/Quest 2 recentering your guardian fixes this. For people on other headsets please find the center of your guardian and try not to move from it when playing AOQ. We are sorry for the inconvenience.</h5>
	
	<h4>Q: Where is the toggle for boost control?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: Boost Control is now the default (and only) boosting option moving forward and as such no longer needs to be selected.</h5>
	
	<h4>Q: Is Attack on Quest going to come to applab?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: We may apply for applab, but it's unlikely to be accepted due to copyright issues.</h5>
	
	<h4>Q: Is this game going to abandon the Oculus Quest 1 when newer hardware comes out?</h4>
	
	<h5>A: We would like to support the Oculus Quest 1 for as long as possible, and have no current plans to stop supporting it.</h5>
	
	<h4>If you have additional questions, please join the Attack on Quest Discord server and ask in #Questions</h4>
